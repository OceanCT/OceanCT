I am interested in distributed systems as well as os development. Yet I am still a beginner.

# Projects 

### Malicious Domains Detecting

1. Main Idea: 
    To detect those malicious and illegal domains(sexual,gambling,etc) and find their common characteristics so that the goverment can block these websites.

2. My work:

    Input: domains,keywords
    Output: processed html of websites returned by search engines
    2.2. SSL crawling
    Input: domains
    Output: their ca info
